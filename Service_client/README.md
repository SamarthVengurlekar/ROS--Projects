# Service_client with python

From the previous project [Closed_loop_System](https://github.com/SamarthVengurlekar/ROS--Projects/tree/main/Closed_loop_System) we were able to control turtle 
so that it can move around and not hit the wall.
Now in this project we are spliting the turtle window into two halves. 
On the right half, the pen tracing color will be red and on the left half, the pen tracing color will be green.

## Expected result:-

So we are going to code a service client inside our turtle controller so that we can modify the color of the tracer pen depending on where the turtle is.
###### This is modified code for the [turtle_controller](turtle_controller.py) and it is also included above.

## Output:-
Cmd feedback mesage with the expected output:
